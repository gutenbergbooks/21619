<h3>THE SPOTTED FAWN</h3>

<p>When Nimble's mother first looked at
him she couldn't believe she would ever
be able to raise him. He was such a tiny,
frail, spotted thing that he seemed too
delicate for a life of adventure on the
wooded ridges and in the tangled swamps
under the shadow of Blue Mountain.</p>

<p>"Bless me!" cried the good lady.
"This child's not much taller than an
overgrown beet top and he can't be any
heavier than one of Farmer Green's prize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
cabbages. And his legs&mdash;" she exclaimed&mdash;"his
legs are no thicker than pea pods.... They'll
be ready to eat in another
month," she added, meaning <i>not</i> her
child's legs, as you might have supposed,
but Farmer Green's early June peas.
For Nimble's mother was very fond of
certain vegetables that did not grow wild
in the woods.</p>

<p>Of course young Nimble did not know
what she was talking about. He had a
great deal to learn. And he would have
to wait until he was a good deal bigger
before his mother took him on an excursion,
by night, across the fields to Farmer
Green's garden patch.</p>

<p>All at once Nimble leaped quickly upon
his slightly wobbly legs. He trembled
and gazed up at his mother with a look
of fear in his great eyes. At the same
time his mother, too, lifted her head and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
listened for a few moments. "Don't be
afraid!" she said then, to Nimble.
"That's old Spot&mdash;Farmer Green's dog&mdash;barking.
But he's down near the barns,
so we don't need to worry."</p>

<p>That was the first time Nimble had ever
heard a dog's voice. Yet no one needed to
tell him that it wasn't a pleasant sound.</p>

<p>Even his mother couldn't help feeling
that she had better put a wide stretch of
rough country between her new youngster
and old Spot's home. So in a little
while she led the way slowly along the
pine grown ridge which bent around a
shoulder of the mountain. She was
headed for the spring which marked the
beginning of Broad Brook.</p>

<p>Her little spotted fawn, Nimble, kept
close beside her. Slowly as his mother
moved, he found the traveling none too
easy. And he was glad when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
stopped in a pocket-like clearing. There
she spoke to a proud speckled bird who
was sitting on a log and amusing himself
by spreading his tail feathers into a
beautiful fan.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Grouse!" said
Nimble's mother.</p>

<p>"Good morning, madam!" replied the
gentleman with the fan. "What a handsome
child you have! There's nothing
quite like spots&mdash;or speckles&mdash;to add to a
person's looks."</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> pretty," Nimble's mother
agreed with a happy glance at her son.</p>

<p>"I can't say he favors his mother," Mr.
Grouse remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I had spots enough when I was
young," she explained. "You see, all our
family lose our spots as we grow up."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to say," Mr. Grouse said
with a flirt of his tail, "that all our family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
keep their spots, every one of them."</p>

<p>"We get to be so swift-footed that we
don't need spots," said Nimble's mother.</p>

<p>That speech seemed to displease Mr.
Grouse.</p>

<p>"I hope," he cried, "you don't mean
to say that we Grouse aren't swift!"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" Nimble's mother answered
hastily.</p>

<p>"I should hope <i>not</i>!" was Mr. Grouse's
response to that. "For everybody knows
that we go up like rockets at the slightest
sign of danger."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" said Nimble's mother.
"You are so swift that you don't really
need those spots to help conceal yourself,
once you're grown up."</p>

<p>"They're handy to have, all the same,"
he told her. "And as for this youngster
of yours, you needn't worry much about
him. He'll be safe enough in the woods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
He looks just like a patch of sunlight that
has fallen through a tree top upon a leaf-strewn
bank."</p>

<p>Nimble's mother was pleased to hear
that.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Mr. Grouse cheerfully.
"He'll be safe enough&mdash;except for the
Foxes."</p>

<p>And that remark didn't please Nimble's
mother at all.</p>

<h3>LEARNING THINGS</h3>

<p>Nimble's mother hadn't liked Mr.
Grouse's remark about Foxes. Somehow
she couldn't put Foxes out of her mind.
And not once did she mean to let Nimble
wander out of her sight.</p>

<p>At first, when he was only a tiny chap,
it was easy for her to keep her young son
near her. But Nimble grew a little livelier
with each day that passed. And it
wasn't long before he began to annoy his
mother and worry her, too. For he soon
fell into the habit of dodging behind something
or other, such as a baby pine tree or
a clump of blackberry bushes, when his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
mother wasn't looking. Every time she
missed her spotted fawn the poor lady
was sure a Fox had snatched him up and
dragged him away. And when she found
Nimble again she was so glad that she
hadn't the heart to punish him.</p>

<p>However, one day she talked to him
quite severely.</p>

<p>"Do you want a Fox to catch&mdash;and eat&mdash;you?"
she asked him.</p>

<p>"No, Mother!... Has a Fox ever
eaten you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" Nimble's mother answered.</p>

<p>"Do you expect to be caught by a Fox?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" said his mother.</p>

<p>"Then there can't be any great danger,"
Nimble remarked lightly.</p>

<p>"Ah! There's always danger of Foxes
so long as you're a little fawn," she explained.
"When you're grown up&mdash;or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
even half grown&mdash;no Fox would dare
touch you. But if you wandered away
alone at your tender age and you met a
Fox&mdash;&mdash;" Well, the poor lady was so upset
by the mere thought of what might
happen that she couldn't say anything
more just then.</p>

<p>But her son Nimble was not upset.</p>

<p>"If I met a Fox," he declared bravely,
"I'd be safe enough. I'd stand perfectly
still. And he wouldn't be able to see me,
on account of my spots."</p>

<p>"Ah! But if the wind happened to be
blowing his way he'd be sure to smell
you," cried Nimble's mother. "And he
would find you. And he would jump at
you."</p>

<p>"I'd run away from him then," said
Nimble stoutly.</p>

<p>His mother shook her head.</p>

<p>"You're spry for your age. But you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
too slow to escape a Fox. You're not
quick enough for that yet. You don't
know how quick Foxes are. So look out!
Look out for a sly fellow with a pointed
nose and a bushy tail!"</p>

<p>In spite of all these warnings Nimble
didn't feel the least bit alarmed. And the
older he grew the less he heeded his
mother's words. He thought she was too
careful. She seemed always to be on the
watch for some danger. She was forever
stopping to look back, lest somebody or
something might be following her. Whenever
she picked out a good resting place
behind a clump of evergreens, out of the
wind, she never lay down without first retracing
her steps for a little way and peering
all around. Then, of course, she had
to walk back again before she sank down
on the bed of her choosing. It all seemed
very silly to young Nimble.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>"What's the use," he finally asked her
one day, "what's the use of fussing so
much over your back tracks?"</p>

<p>"You should always know what's behind
you," said his mother. "Besides, I
can't rest well if I'm uneasy."</p>

<p>"Do you feel easy now?" he inquired,
for she had just then lain down after giving
her back tracks her usual attention.</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Nimble's mother, as she
closed her eyes and heaved a deep sigh of
contentment.</p>

<p>Her answer pleased Nimble. He smiled
faintly as he watched her closely. And he
chuckled when his mother's head nodded
three times and then sank lower and
lower.</p>

<p>Presently Nimble rose to his feet, without
making the slightest rustle. And very
carefully he stole away.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="t"><a name="Nap" id="Nap">III</a></h2>

<h3>AN INTERRUPTED NAP</h3>

<p>Nimble, the fawn, stole away into the
woods while his mother was sleeping. And
when he went he took great pains not to
disturb her. He was careful not to step
on a single twig. For young as he was,
he knew that the sound of a breaking twig
was enough to rouse his mother instantly
out of the deepest sleep. And he made
sure that he didn't set his little feet on any
stones. For he knew that at the merest
click of a hoof his mother would bound
up and discover that he had left her.</p>

<p>So Nimble trod only upon the soft carpet
of pine needles and made not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
slightest noise. Meanwhile his mother
slept peacefully on&mdash;or as peacefully as
anybody can who is a light sleeper and
keeps one ear always cocked to catch every
stir in the forest.</p>

<p>She never missed her son at all until
she found herself suddenly wide awake
and on her feet, ready to run. Not seeing
Nimble beside her, for a moment or two
she forgot she had a child. Her only
thought was to flee from the creature that
was crashing through the underbrush beyond
the old stone wall and drawing
nearer to her every instant.</p>

<p>It was a wonder that she didn't dash off
then and there. Indeed she took one leap
before she remembered who she was and
that she had a youngster named Nimble.</p>

<p>Then, of course, she stopped short and
looked wildly around. But she saw no
little spotted fawn anywhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>She had been startled enough, before,
roused as she was out of a sound sleep.
And now she was terribly frightened.</p>

<p>"Nimble!" she called. "Where are
you?"</p>

<p>"Here I am!" Nimble answered. Even
as he spoke he burst into sight, leaping
the stone wall in such a way that his
mother couldn't help feeling proud of
him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she cried.
"Who's chasing you?"</p>

<p>"Nobody's chasing me," Nimble told
her. "When I saw the Fox I hurried
back here."</p>

<p>"The Fox!" his mother exclaimed.
"Well, he won't dare touch you while I
am with you." She began to breathe
easily again. If it was only a Fox she
certainly didn't intend to run. "Where
did you see the Fox?" she demanded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>"He was right over my head," Nimble
said.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" his mother gasped.
"That was dangerous. Was he on a bank
above you?"</p>

<p>"He was in a tree," Nimble replied.</p>

<p>His mother gave him a queer look.</p>

<p>"What's that?" she asked him sharply.
"In a tree? What did he look like? Was
he red?"</p>

<p>"He was grayish and he had black rings
around his long bushy tail; and his long
pointed nose stuck out from under a black
mask."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Nimble's mother.
"You didn't see a Fox. You saw a Coon!"</p>

<p>Nimble was puzzled.</p>

<p>"You told me once," he reminded his
mother, "that a Fox was a sly fellow with
a bushy tail and a long pointed nose. And
this person in the tree had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>"Yes! Yes!" said his mother. "Now
listen to what I say: A Fox is red. And
his tail has no rings at all. And Foxes
don't climb trees."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother!" was Nimble's meek
answer.</p>

<p>He was glad to learn all that. And he
was glad, too, that his mother hadn't
asked him how he happened to stray off
alone into the woods.</p>

<h3>PLANNING A PICNIC</h3>

<p>While he was only a fawn Nimble became
very fond of water lilies. But he
didn't carry them as a bouquet, nor wear
one in his buttonhole. He was fond of
lilies in a different way: he liked to eat
them, and their flat, round, glossy pads.
At night his mother often led him to the
edge of the lake on the other side of Blue
Mountain and there they feasted.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to stand in the cool
water, not too far from the shore, with
the moonlight shimmering on the ruffled
lake, and breathe in the sweet scent of the
lilies while nibbling at their pads.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>"There's nothing," said Nimble to his
mother one night, "nothing so good to eat
as water lilies."</p>

<p>His mother said, "Humph! Wait till
you've tasted carrots!"</p>

<p>"Carrots!" Nimble echoed. "What are
carrots and where can I find some? Do
they grow in this lake?"</p>

<p>"Carrots," his mother explained, "are
vegetables and they grow in Farmer
Green's garden."</p>

<p>When he heard that, Nimble wanted to
start for Farmer Green's place at once.
But his mother said, "No!" And he soon
saw that she meant it, too.</p>

<p>However, the word <i>carrots</i> was in his
mouth a good deal of the time, for days
and nights afterward. But Nimble wasn't
satisfied with having only the <i>word</i> in his
mouth. There was no taste to that at all.
Nor could he chew it, nor swallow it. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
was wild to bite into a carrot and see if it
actually was more toothsome than a water
lily. Again and again he said to his
mother, "Can't we go down to Farmer
Green's garden patch to-night? If we
wait much longer somebody else will eat
all the carrots before we get a taste of
them." Or maybe he would exclaim,
"Let's have some carrots for supper!
Please!"</p>

<p>It was no wonder that Nimble's mother
grew very tired of his teasing. At last
she said to him, when he was urging her
to take him down the hill and across the
meadow to Farmer Green's vegetable
garden, "There's no sense in our going
down there now. The carrots aren't big
enough yet. They aren't ready to eat.
But later, if you show you're trustworthy,
and if you mind well, and if you grow
enough, and if you can start quickly and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
run fast, perhaps I'll see that you have
your first meal of carrots. Now, don't
bother me any more!"</p>

<p>Well, there were so many <i>ifs</i> in his
mother's promise that Nimble almost gave
up hope of ever getting to Farmer
Green's garden patch. He didn't quite
dare expect that his mother would take
him there with her. But he made up his
mind that if she didn't he would go on a
carrot hunt alone as soon as he could.</p>

<p>At the same time he practiced minding
his mother, which was not always a pleasant
thing to do. And he practiced starting
and running, both of which were a
good deal of fun. As for growing, Nimble
did not need to practice that at all; for he
was getting heavier and taller every day,
without doing anything more than to eat
and to sleep and to have the best time
possible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span><a name="meanwhile" id="meanwhile"></a>Meanwhile he told everybody he met
that if all went well he would be eating
carrots some day. And when his friends
learned that he planned to go on an excursion
to Farmer Green's garden patch
there wasn't one of them that didn't say
he would like to go too.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit said he really ought to
have a look at the cabbages. And if Nimble
didn't mind he thought it would be
pleasant to join the party. Patty Coon
remarked that there were certain matters
connected with corn which he must attend
to, and if there was no objection he
would go along with the rest, when the
time came for the excursion. Even Cuffy
Bear, who almost never went near the
farm buildings, declared that there was
nothing he would enjoy more than to make
the trip with Nimble and his mother. He
had once tasted baked beans. And ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
since that occasion he had meant to see if
he couldn't find some around Farmer
Green's house.</p>

<p>Of course it would have been awkward
to say no. So Nimble said yes to everybody.
He even promised that he would let
all his friends know when the excursion
should take place.</p>

<p>But of all these things he said not a
word to his mother. He was not sure that
they would please her. In fact he was
sure that they wouldn't.</p>

<h3>NIMBLE'S MISTAKE</h3>

<p>One morning Nimble's mother said to
him, "To-night, just as the moon rises,
we'll start for Farmer Green's garden
patch."</p>

<p>He knew what that meant. It meant
that he was going to know, at last, what
carrots tasted like. And he was delighted.</p>

<p>"You've improved fast," his mother
told him. "You've grown a good deal.
You start to run much more quickly than
you did a month ago; and you're quite
speedy now. I must say that you don't
mind me any too well. Take care that to-night
you do exactly as you're ordered!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>Nimble promised. "I'll be good," he
said. "No matter how many carrots you
want me to eat, I'll finish every one."</p>

<p>"No matter if you haven't had a chance
to eat a single carrot, if I tell you to run
you must obey instantly," his mother
warned him. "Two seconds' delay might
be fatal," she added solemnly. "If we
hear a twig snap you mustn't stop to look
nor listen."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Nimble. But ten minutes
later he couldn't have repeated a word
that his mother said&mdash;except that they
were going to start for the garden when
the moon rose. That much he told Jimmy
Rabbit when he met him in the woods a
little while afterward. And Jimmy Rabbit
agreed to get the news, somehow, to
Fatty Coon and Cuffy Bear.</p>

<p>He was as good as his promise&mdash;even
better. For Jimmy told everybody he met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
that day. He explained about the excursion
to the garden patch and said that
every one must be ready to start just as
the moon peeped over the rim of the
world, for Nimble Deer's mother wouldn't
wait for anybody that wasn't on hand.</p>

<p>Nimble found that day a long one. He
was so eager to get a carrot between his
lips that he thought night would never
come. But darkness fell at last. And
some hours later his mother said to him,
"Are you ready?"</p>

<p>He was. So together they passed
silently along the old runway which led,
as his mother knew, to the pasture fence.
The woods were inky black, for the moon
had not yet risen. But Nimble's mother
remarked that she thought they would
see it when they reached the open hillside.</p>

<p>Just before they came to the fence
somebody spoke. Nimble's mother jump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>ed
when somebody cried, "Good evening!"
But she knew at once that it was
only Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<p>"I see you're on time," he said. "I
haven't been waiting long."</p>

<p>"Waiting?" Nimble's mother exclaimed.
"Waiting for what?"</p>

<p>"For you!" he answered. "I heard you
were going down to the garden patch to-night;
and I'm to be one of the party."</p>

<p>The good lady thought it queer. How
did Jimmy Rabbit happen to have heard
of the excursion? She couldn't imagine.
But he was a harmless little fellow.
Really she didn't mind having him go
with her.</p>

<p>"Very well!" she told him. "But remember:
You must be quiet!" And she
was just about to walk up to the fence
when she gave a searching look all around.
"Bless me!" she muttered. "I never saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
so many eyes in all my life. Who are all
these people?"</p>

<p>It was no wonder she asked that question.
For no matter where she turned,
pairs of eyes burned in the darkness.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, nobody answered.
Jimmy Rabbit didn't say a word. And as
for Nimble, he didn't seem to hear&mdash;nor
understand&mdash;anything his mother said.</p>

<p>"I repeat," she spoke again, "who are
these people? Why have they gathered
here? The woods aren't afire, are they?"
And she lifted her nose and sniffed at the
air. But she could find no trace of smoke.</p>

<p>Somehow Nimble began to feel ill at
ease. He edged away from his mother
and tried to hide behind Jimmy Rabbit.
And that was a ridiculous thing to do;
because Nimble was ever so much the bigger
of the two.</p>

<p>Presently his mother gave him a sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
look. And then he, too, raised his muzzle
and sniffed.</p>

<p>"I don't smell any smoke," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Do you know why there's such a crowd
here?" she asked him sternly.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "they expect to go
to the garden patch with us."</p>

<p>And his mother wondered, then, why
she hadn't guessed the secret instantly.</p>

<h2 class="t"><a name="Party" id="Party">VI</a></h2>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED PARTY</h3>

<p>Nimble's mother's plans went all awry.
She had expected to give her son a treat
by taking him quietly to Farmer Green's
carrot patch, so that he might have his
first taste of carrots. So it wasn't strange
that it upset her a bit when she found
that there were dozens of other forest folk
all ready and waiting to go along with
them. One extra member of the party
wouldn't have displeased her, especially
when that one was Jimmy Rabbit. But
she had never gone near the farm buildings
with more than two others. And she
didn't intend to break her rule now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>Besides, it annoyed her above all to
know that her son had spread the news of
the excursion far and wide.</p>

<p>"Did you <i>invite</i> these people?" she
asked Nimble in a low voice.</p>

<p>"No! Oh, no!"</p>

<p>"Then what brings them here?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"Their legs, I suppose," he replied.</p>

<p>"Be careful!" she said. "Be very careful!"</p>

<p>Then Nimble began to whine. And that
was something he almost never did.</p>

<p>"They said they'd like to come," he
told his mother. "And I said maybe you
wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>"Well, I do mind," she declared firmly.
"When I take a child to the carrot patch
for the first time I don't want company.
One of this crowd is more than likely to
rouse old dog Spot. And we can't have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
him ranging around while we're dining."</p>

<p>"Then tell everybody to go home!"
Nimble suggested. "Tell them to go
'way!"</p>

<p>"No!" said his mother. "That wouldn't
be polite."</p>

<p>She was silent for a few moments. And
then she explained to Jimmy Rabbit and
to the owners of the pairs of eyes that still
stared at her out of the darkness. She
explained that on account of an unexpected
party she wasn't going to the carrot
patch that night.</p>

<p>"When are you going?" asked the
owner of one pair of specially bright eyes.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Nimble's mother exclaimed.
"Is that Cuffy Bear speaking?"</p>

<p>"Yessum!" said the same voice.</p>

<p>"I fear," she told him, "I may not be
able to go for a long time."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" Cuffy cried. "I can go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
any night&mdash;that is, until I den up for the
winter."</p>

<p>And every one in the company declared
that he hadn't a single engagement that
would prevent him from visiting the garden
whenever Nimble's mother should
say the word.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "it won't be to-night,
anyhow." And with that she turned
around and began to walk along the runway
again, away from the pasture fence.</p>

<p>As Nimble followed her Jimmy Rabbit
skipped alongside him and whispered in
his ear.</p>

<p>"Don't fail to let me know when the
time comes!"</p>

<p>But Nimble said never a word. Somehow
he suspected that he had made a
great mistake.</p>

<p>He <i>knew</i> he had, a little later.</p>

<h3>THE STRANGE LIGHT</h3>

<p>Weeks went by; and still Nimble's
mother said no more about visiting Farmer
Green's carrot patch. Nimble himself
did not dare to mention carrots now.
It was his own fault that the excursion
had been postponed. And much as he still
wanted a taste of carrots the whole affair
was something he didn't care to talk
about.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was lucky that he liked
water lilies. For his mother took him to
the lake behind Blue Mountain every
night, almost. And there they splashed
in the shallows and ate all they wanted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>Most of those nights were much alike.
But there was one that Nimble remembered
for many a day afterward.</p>

<p>It was not a dark night; neither was it
a light one. It was a half-and-half sort
of night. There was a moon. But it was
far from full. And it was not high in the
sky. The light from it came slanting
down upon the lake, throwing the shadows
of the trees far out upon the water.</p>

<p>Where those shadows reached out
darkly Nimble and his mother stood with
the water lapping their sleek bodies. And
they were eating so busily that neither of
them noticed a blurred shape that glided
slowly nearer and nearer to them, without
making the slightest sound.</p>

<p>All at once a shaft of dazzling light
swept along the shore. Nimble was so
surprised and puzzled that he stopped
eating to stand still and gaze at it.</p>

<span class="image"><a href="#had"><i>Page</i> 42</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>But only for a moment! Instantly his
mother flung her tail upward, so that the
under side of it gleamed white even in the
half light. And that&mdash;as Nimble knew
right well&mdash;that was the danger signal.</p>

<p>Almost before Nimble knew what was
happening his mother made for the shore.
As she plunged through the water her tail,
still aloft like a flag, twitched from side
to side.</p>

<p>Nimble needed no urging to follow it.
Soon they scrambled, dripping, out of the
lake to dive headlong into the cover of the
overhanging willows.</p>

<p>In those few seconds the light darted
swiftly towards them. But it was not
quite quick enough. Only the ripples told
where they had been standing. Only the
gently waving branches of the willows
showed where Nimble and his mother had
vanished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>A noise like a thunder-clap crashed
upon Nimble's ears and rolled and tumbled
in the distance, tossed from the
mountain to the hills across the lake, and
back again. It frightened Nimble much
more than did the odd whistle that whined
just above his head a moment before the
thunder peal.</p>

<p><a name="had" id="had"></a>Never had he run so fast before. Never
had his mother set such a pace for him.
Usually, when startled, she stopped after
going a short distance and looked back to
try to get a glimpse of whoever or whatever
had alarmed her. To be sure, she
always stopped in a good place, like the
edge of Cedar Swamp, where she could
duck out of sight if need be.</p>

<p>But this time Nimble's mother ran on
and on without pausing.</p>

<p>"Haven't you forgotten something?"
her son gasped after a while.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>"Forgotten something? What do you
mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Haven't you forgotten to stop?"
Nimble inquired.</p>

<p>A queer look came over her face.</p>

<p>"I declare," she said, "I do believe I'd
Have run all night if you hadn't reminded
me." She fell into a walk. And neither
of them said another word until they
reached the swamp, which was one of his
mother's favorite hiding places. Then
Nimble spoke again.</p>

<p>"I waved my flag too," he said proudly.</p>

<h3>MRS. DEER EXPLAINS</h3>

<p>For the first time in his life Nimble felt
quite grown up. He forgot that he had
not yet lived a whole summer. He had
made a suggestion to his mother which
she had promptly acted upon. It had
never happened before. And that was
enough to cause him great pleasure.</p>

<p>Then there was something else that
made Nimble believe himself to be a person
of some account: A strange affair
had happened at the lake. He had seen
it all. He had taken part in it himself.
Really it was no wonder that he began to
talk quite importantly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>"It was lucky I was with you," he remarked
to his mother as they rested amid
the tangle of Cedar Swamp.</p>

<p>"It was lucky we weren't any further
out in the lake," she exclaimed. "If you
hadn't been with me no doubt I'd have
gone where the water was much deeper.
And that light would have caught me
before I could have reached the shore."</p>

<p>What his mother said made Nimble feel
bigger than ever. He wasn't quite sure
what had happened back there, where
they had been surprised while eating
water lilies. But he meant to find out, for
he thought it would make a good story to
tell his friends.</p>

<p>"Would the moon have burnt us if it
had hit us?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you talking
about?" his mother asked him.</p>

<p>He looked puzzled at her question.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>"Wasn't that the moon that lit up the
lake along the shore?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" she replied.</p>

<p>"Didn't the moon fall into the water?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" his mother cried. She
was astonished at his question.</p>

<p>Nimble was disappointed. He had
thought he had a wonderful tale to tell.
And he couldn't understand yet why
everything wasn't as he had supposed.</p>

<p>"I was sure the moon fell into the lake
and blew up," he explained. "What was
that terrible noise we heard if it wasn't
the moon bursting into pieces?"</p>

<p>His mother didn't laugh. Instead she
was quite solemn as she answered Nimble's
last question.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;" she said&mdash;"that was a gun
that you heard. And the light that
you saw came from a lantern in a boat."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>It was very hard for Nimble to believe
what she told him.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a piece of the moon
whistle past my head," he went on.</p>

<p>"A bullet!" his mother declared. As
she spoke she moved a little distance, to
a spot where the trees were not so thick.
And she raised her nose towards the sky.
"There!" she said. "There's the moon!
It's still up there where you've always
seen it."</p>

<p>Nimble looked; and at last he knew that
his mother had made no mistake. But
somehow he was more frightened than
ever.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;" he faltered&mdash;"then there
must have been men in the boat&mdash;men
that turned the light upon the shore&mdash;and
fired the gun!"</p>

<p>"They were men&mdash;yes!" said his
mother. "And they were lawbreakers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
too. I hope the game warden will catch
them at their tricks."</p>

<p>"What is a game warden?" Nimble
asked her.</p>

<p>"He's a man," she answered. "He's a
man that looks after all of us forest folk
and he's the best friend we've got.... Goodness,
child! Are you never going to
stop asking questions?"</p>

<h3>A SPIKE HORN</h3>

<p>Nimble didn't mind losing his spots, when
he grew older. He had something else
that gave him much more pleasure than
they ever had. He had a new toy. Or to
be exact, he had two new toys. And
everywhere he went he carried them with
him.</p>

<p>He carried them on his head. And he
couldn't have left them behind in the
woods even if he had wanted to&mdash;at least
not until he had enjoyed them for a whole
season.</p>

<p>Of course you have already guessed that
he had a pair of horns. They were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
very big. But neither was Nimble, for
that matter. So they suited him well. A
little deer like him would have looked
queer wearing great branching horns such
as his father owned.</p>

<p>Nimble's horns were merely two spikes
which stuck up out of the top of his head
in a pert fashion.</p>

<p>It was a proud day for him when an old
deer spoke to him and called him "young
Spike Horn." About that time the forest
folk had begun to speak of him as a "yearling."
But there was something about
"Spike Horn" that sounded much more
important.</p>

<p>Somehow there was a new crop of Spike
Horns that summer&mdash;Nimble's second
summer. And every one of them had
been&mdash;like him&mdash;a little spotted fawn the
year before.</p>

<p>At first Nimble had thought it fun to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
use his new horns to jab anybody that
happened to be with him. One day he
even stole up behind his own mother and
gave her a sharp prod with them.</p>

<p>He never did that again. His mother
quickly taught him better. She wheeled
and struck him smartly with her fore feet.</p>

<p>"There!" she cried. "That's the first
time a child of mine has played that trick
on me.... Let it be the last!"</p>

<p>And it was. Nimble was very careful,
after that, to prod only those that didn't
mind such pranks.</p>

<p>Luckily he soon found that the other
Spike Horns liked the same sort of fun
that he did. They were just as proud of
their new horns as he was of his. And
(sad to say!) there was a good deal of
boasting among them. Each one declared
that his own horns were the longest and
strongest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>All the Spike Horns, including Nimble,
were forever butting one another in
play. And they had just discovered a new
sport when Nimble met with what he
feared, for a time, was a terrible accident.</p>

<p>Late in the fall, before the deep snows
came, both his horns loosened and dropped
off his head.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" he cried when he saw what
had happened. "I'll never be able to take
part in another mock battle again!" For
the Spike Horns had had gay times pretending
to fight one another in a most savage
fashion.</p>

<p>After Nimble lost his horns he carefully
avoided all his playmates. He didn't
want the other Spike Horns to see him.
At last, to his great dismay, one day he
came face to face with one of them. They
both tried to dodge out of sight. But the
other, whose name was Dodger, was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
quite quick enough. Before he hid behind
a thicket Nimble saw that he had lost his
horns too!</p>

<p>Then Nimble guessed the truth. He
knew why it was that he had managed to
keep out of sight of his friends. Every
Spike Horn in the neighborhood had lost
his horns! And every one of them had
been trying to keep out of sight.</p>

<h3>AT THE CARROT PATCH</h3>

<p>During his first summer Nimble never
reached Farmer Green's carrot patch
once. His mother had planned to take
him there. But on account of an unexpected
party she had postponed their
visit. And somehow the right night for a
trip after carrots never seemed to come
again.</p>

<p>Now, Nimble had never forgotten what
his mother had told him about carrots.
And he was going after some&mdash;so he
promised himself&mdash;just as soon as he was
big enough.</p>

<p>When Nimble's second summer rolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
around he was big enough and old enough
to prowl through the woods and fields
much as he pleased. He was a Spike
Horn. And he felt fit to go to the carrot
patch without waiting for anybody to
show him the way.</p>

<p>So one night he stole down the hillside
pasture, across the meadow, and jumped
the fence into Farmer Green's garden.</p>

<p>He saw at once that somebody was
there ahead of him. It was Jimmy Rabbit.
He was very busy with one of Farmer
Green's cabbages.</p>

<p>"I've come down to try the carrots,"
said Nimble.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit made no reply, except to
nod his head slightly. He was eating so
fast that he really couldn't speak just
then.</p>

<p>"Are these carrots?" Nimble inquired,
as he looked about at the big cabbages,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
which crossed the garden in long rows.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.</p>

<p>"They seem to be good," said Nimble,
"whatever they are. I'll taste of one."</p>

<p>And he did. In fact he tasted of three
or four of them, eating their centers out
neatly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jimmy Rabbit was becoming
uneasy. And at last he spoke.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, "you told me you
had come down here to try the carrots."</p>

<p>"So I did," Nimble answered. "But I
don't know where the carrots are."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so before?"
Jimmy Rabbit asked him. And without
waiting for a reply he cried, "Follow me!
I'll show you." And he hopped off
briskly, with Nimble after him.</p>

<p>Soon Jimmy Rabbit came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" he said. "Here's the carrot
patch. Help yourself!" And then he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
hopped away again, back to his supper of
cabbages.</p>

<p>Nimble Deer began to eat the carrot
tops. And he was greatly disappointed.</p>

<p>"They're not half as good as those great
round balls," he muttered. And he
turned away from the carrots, to go back
and join Jimmy Rabbit. But he hadn't
gone far when he met Jimmy bounding
along in a great hurry.</p>

<p>"Old dog Spot!" Jimmy Rabbit gasped
as he whisked past Nimble. "He's out
to-night and he's coming this way."</p>

<p><a name="follow" id="follow"></a>In one leap Nimble sprang completely
around and followed Jimmy Rabbit
across the meadow, up through the pasture
and over the stone wall into the
woods. There they lost each other.</p>

<p>The next morning Nimble met his
mother along the ridge that ran down toward
Cedar Swamp.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>"I went down to the carrot patch last
night," he told her. "And I must say I
don't see why you're so fond of carrots.
They're not half as good as some big
green balls that I found in the garden. I
call the carrot leaves tough. But the big
green balls have very tender leaves."</p>

<p>His mother gave him a queer look.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," she asked
him, "that you ate only the <i>leaves</i> of the
carrots?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" said Nimble. "I saw
nothing else to eat. There was no fruit
on them."</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried his mother. "You have to
dig with your toes to reach the carrots
themselves. They're down in the ground.
And to my mind there's nothing any
juicier and sweeter and tenderer than nice
young carrots, eaten by the light of the
moon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>Nimble felt very foolish. And then he
tossed his head and said lightly, "Oh,
well! It wouldn't have made any difference
if I <i>had</i> dug the carrots out of the
dirt. They wouldn't have tasted right
anyhow. For there was no moon last
night!"</p>

<h3>CUFFY AND THE CAVE</h3>

<p>Nimble did not spend all his spare moments
with the other Spike Horns. Once
in a while he met Cuffy Bear prowling
about near the foot of Blue Mountain.
But Nimble never had a mock battle with
Cuffy. Cuffy Bear was a famous boxer.
And in each of his paws he carried long
sharp claws. What if Cuffy should forget
to pull in those claws sometime, when he
struck you a playful tap? Ah! That
wouldn't be very pleasant! This was
what Nimble thought about the matter.
So he never butted Cuffy Bear nor pricked
him with his spikes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>On the whole they found each other
good company. Cuffy liked to see Nimble
jump. And Nimble liked to see Cuffy
climb trees.</p>

<p>One day, late in the fall, that year when
Nimble was a Spike Horn, he strayed half
way up the side of Blue Mountain. It
was seldom that Nimble wandered so far
up the steep and thickly wooded slopes.
But old dog Spot was ranging about the
lower woods. And for once Nimble did
not run for Cedar Swamp when he heard
the old dog bay. Instead he climbed steadily
until he was sure that he had shaken
Spot off his trail.</p>

<p>Nimble had stopped for a drink at the
spring which marked the beginning of
Broad Brook and there he met Cuffy
Bear, who was just turning away from
the ice-framed pool. "Aren't you a long
way from home?" Cuffy asked him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>"Yes! But I can get down to my favorite
ridge quickly enough, when I want
to," said Nimble. "Do you live in this
neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure," Cuffy Bear replied.
"I've had my eye on a snug den a
little further up the mountain. I'm
thinking of living there, if it suits me.... Wouldn't
you like to see it?"</p>

<p>Nimble told Cuffy that he would be delighted.
So they started up the mountain,
after Nimble had had his drink.</p>

<p>Cuffy Bear led the way. And in a short
time he stopped in front of a cave. A
tangle of bushes hid the mouth of it.
You'd have passed right by it without
ever guessing that there was any cave
there.</p>

<p>"This is it," Cuffy Bear told Nimble.
"Come right in!"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I'd rather not," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
Nimble. "I don't care for caves, myself,
though this seems to be a good one."</p>

<p>"It's worth seeing," Cuffy Bear urged.</p>

<p>"No, thank you!" Nimble repeated.</p>

<p>"You don't mind if I take a look at it?"
Cuffy Bear inquired. "Maybe I can make
up my mind&mdash;about living here&mdash;if I look
at the cave once more."</p>

<p>"Go inside, by all means!" Nimble
cried.</p>

<p>"Will you wait here till I come out?"
Cuffy asked him.</p>

<p>And Nimble promised that he would
wait.</p>

<p>Cuffy Bear yawned as he turned away.
And Nimble thought it strange that he
didn't take the trouble to beg pardon, nor
to cover the yawn with a paw. Only a
very careless&mdash;or a very sleepy&mdash;person
would forget those things, Nimble knew.</p>

<p>Well, Cuffy crept inside the cave. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
outside Nimble waited. He waited and
waited, until at last the afternoon light
began to fade.</p>

<p>"I wish he'd hurry," Nimble muttered.
"We're going to have a storm and I don't
want to stay up here in it, all night."</p>

<p>Snowflakes were already falling. And
Nimble wished he hadn't promised that he
would wait till Cuffy Bear came out of
the cave.</p>

<p>He went to the entrance and called. But
he got no answer.</p>

<p>"I hope nothing has happened to him,"
Nimble said.</p>

<p>But something had.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span></p>
<h2  class="t"><a name="Missing" id="Missing">XII</a></h2>

<h3>CUFFY IS MISSING</h3>

<p>Far up on the dark mountainside, in the
driving snow, Nimble waited in front of
the cave where Cuffy Bear had vanished.
And all the time Nimble was growing
more uneasy. He feared that Cuffy Bear
might be in some sort of trouble.</p>

<p>Nimble looked all about for help. But
there wasn't a sign of anybody stirring,
anywhere. All the mountain people
seemed to have sought shelter from the
storm.</p>

<p>At last, however, Peter Mink came
sneaking up from the spring. He had
set out to follow Broad Brook all the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
up to its beginning, on a hunt for meadow
mice. And when he set out to do a thing
he always finished it, no matter what the
weather might be.</p>

<p>"You're just the person I want to see!"
Nimble cried. "Will you do me a favor?"</p>

<p>Now, Peter Mink never did anybody a
favor if he could help it. So he promptly
said, "No!"</p>

<p>"Won't you go inside this cave for
me and see what's happened to Cuffy
Bear?" Nimble implored him. "He
went inside the cave. I promised to
wait for him here. And he has been gone
for hours."</p>

<p>"I won't go into that cave for anybody,"
Peter Mink declared. "How do I
know you're not trying to play a trick on
me? I don't see any Bear tracks in the
snow."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't!" Nimble agreed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
"All this snow has fallen since Cuffy
crawled into the cave."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go inside yourself?"
Peter Mink inquired with something very
like a sneer.</p>

<p>"I'm too tall," said Nimble. "Besides,
I don't like caves. I keep out of them."</p>

<p>"So do I!" Peter Mink declared&mdash;though
everybody knew that he went
everywhere&mdash;even under the ice along
Broad Brook and Swift River.</p>

<p>Poor Nimble didn't know what to do.
He felt that he ought to go for help, somewhere.
But he had promised Cuffy Bear
to wait for him.</p>

<p>Then all at once an idea came to him.
Why not send Peter Mink for help?</p>

<p>"Won't you please go down to Cedar
Swamp and ask Fatty Coon to come up
here?" Nimble begged Peter.</p>

<p>"I can't," Peter answered. "I must go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
home now." And everybody knew that
Peter Mink had no home at all! He was
the vagabond of the woods.</p>

<p>Nimble saw then that it was useless to
look for help from him. And after Peter
Mink had gone his surly way Nimble still
lingered there. He was hungry. So he
began to paw the snow away here and
there, to uncover the ground growths.
And just as he was nibbling beside a bush
somebody said, "Don't step on me!"</p>

<p>It was Mr. Grouse, half buried in the
snow.</p>

<p>"I wondered why you were waiting
here so long," Mr. Grouse told Nimble.
"When I heard you talking to that rascal,
Peter Mink, I knew the reason. But
I didn't dare speak while he was about."</p>

<p>"Are you going to spend the night
here?" Nimble asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Mr. Grouse. "I shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
snug and warm after the snow covers me."</p>

<p>"Well, your head won't be covered for
some time," Nimble told him. "Are you
willing to keep an eye out for Cuffy Bear?
I'm going down to Cedar Swamp to get
help. And Cuffy Bear might come out of
the cave while I'm gone."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to watch," Mr. Grouse replied,
"but it wouldn't be any use."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Nimble asked him. "Don't
you think we'll see Cuffy again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll see him," Mr. Grouse answered.
"But it won't be till towards
spring. For there's no doubt that Cuffy
Bear has fallen into his winter's sleep."</p>

<p>And then Nimble exclaimed that Cuffy
Bear had yawned as he turned away to
enter the cave. He hadn't even begged
pardon, nor covered his mouth with a paw.</p>

<p>"No doubt he was very, very sleepy," said
Mr. Grouse.</p>

<h3>CUFFY BEAR WAKENS</h3>

<p>The winter after Nimble lost his spike
horns was a mild one. The snowfall was
light. And Nimble was able to roam up
and down Pleasant Valley and about Blue
Mountain as he pleased.</p>

<p>It happened that a certain bright day
in early spring found him far up the side
of the mountain, near the cave where he
had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before.
And as that whole queer affair came back
to his mind Nimble remembered how he
had fed upon the green things under the
snow.</p>

<p>That thought made him hungry. So he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
began to paw away the soft heavy snow,
which wasn't more than a foot deep; and
he was enjoying a good meal when he
heard a sudden <i>woof</i> behind him.</p>

<p>Nimble wheeled instantly. And there,
at the mouth of the cave, peering over the
tangle which screened it, Cuffy Bear stood
upon his hind legs, rubbing his eyes.
Catching sight of Nimble, Cuffy blinked
at him.</p>

<p>"Where's Nimble Deer, madam?"
Cuffy Bear growled presently.</p>

<p>"I'm right here!" Nimble replied.
"But please don't call me 'madam!'"</p>

<p>"You're not Nimble Deer. You're a
Doe," Cuffy Bear insisted. "You have
no horns."</p>

<p><a name="about" id="about"></a>"I'm a Deer," Nimble retorted. "I
had horns; but I've shed them."</p>

<p>Cuffy Bear <i>woofed</i> a bit more. He
seemed to be somewhat ill-tempered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>"You can't fool me," he grunted.
"Nimble Deer's horns were firm upon his
head when I left him here and stepped inside
this cave. He agreed to wait for me;
and I'm surprised that he broke his
promise."</p>

<p>"I am Nimble Deer," Nimble declared
again. "You led me to this spot from the
spring. You told me you wanted to take
another look at this cave because you were
thinking of making it your winter home."</p>

<p>Cuffy Bear eyed Nimble with astonishment.
And he shambled up to Nimble and
sniffed at him.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> you!" Cuffy cried at last. "So
you <i>did</i> wait for me!"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," Nimble confessed.</p>

<p>"But here you are!" Cuffy Bear retorted.
"You <i>must</i> have been waiting for
me. And if I've kept you a bit longer
than I intended to, I'm sorry. I think I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>fell asleep in that den and had a short
nap."</p>

<p>"A short nap!" Nimble repeated.
"You've been asleep in there all winter!
It's weeks and weeks since I last saw you.
And I'm here now only because I happened
to wander this way, when I heard
old dog Spot baying."</p>

<p>Cuffy Bear was so surprised that he
couldn't say another word. His mouth
fell open. And he gazed blankly at
Nimble.</p>

<p>But at last he spoke. "I must apologize
to you," he said, "though it was
really no wonder I called you 'madam.'
You have changed a great deal since I left
you here."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;" Nimble told him&mdash;"you
have changed too."</p>

<p>"I have?" Cuffy Bear cried. "How's
that? How have I changed?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span></p>
<p>"You look much hungrier," Nimble
explained.</p>

<p>Cuffy Bear laid a paw across his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> hungry," he admitted. "And if
you're going down the mountain I think
I'll stroll along with you and see what I
can find to eat."</p>

<p>"Very well!" Nimble agreed.</p>

<p>"One moment!" Cuffy Bear said hastily.
"Just one moment, please! Wait till
I go inside my cave! I believe I left my
cap in there."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to wait for you," Nimble
replied firmly. "For all I know you
might not come out again till haying
time."</p>

<p>And then Nimble trotted off down the
mountainside, heading for Cedar Swamp.
For he didn't think old dog Spot would
wander in that direction.</p>

<h3>ANTLERS</h3>

<p>Although Nimble had lost his horns he
managed to go through the winter without
missing them as much as he had expected.
And in time he had almost forgotten
the pair of spikes that he had worn
on his head the summer before. Then,
one day, he made a great discovery. He
found that new horns were sprouting to
take the place of those that he had lost!</p>

<p>"Now I can have some mock battles
again&mdash;when my horns get long enough,"
he thought. And then he stopped short.
What if the Spike Horns of the year
before had no more horns? If they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
hornless they certainly wouldn't care to
take part in any mock battles.</p>

<p>Nimble's fears were soon set at rest.
His old playmates soon let him know that
they were all going to have new horns too.</p>

<p>And then, a little later, Nimble made
another great discovery. He was looking
into a pool one morning when he saw
something that gave him huge delight.
His new horns were not like last year's
horns. He beheld, mirrored in the water,
a handsome pair of Y-shaped antlers,
each with two points!</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he cried. "I'll make those
Spike Horns feel like hiding themselves
again."</p>

<p>He had expected to have a pleasant time
showing his new antlers to his old friends.
When he met Dodger the Deer, Nimble
called to him: "See what I've got! Antlers!
Two points!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ho!" said Dodger. "So have I got
antlers. And they have two points, too."</p>

<p>Nimble had been so interested in his
own horns that he hadn't looked at Dodger's.
And now when he gazed at them
he saw that they were like his.</p>

<p>"What about the rest of the Spike
Horns?" Nimble asked Dodger. "Have
they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, they have!" Dodger interrupted.
"I tell you, 'two-pointers' are common
this season."</p>

<p>"So there aren't any more Spike
Horns!" said Nimble somewhat sadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Plenty!" Dodger answered.
"But they're an entirely new crop. They
were fawns last year."</p>

<p>When he heard that bit of news Nimble
felt happier. And as soon as he parted
from Dodger the Deer he went and found
some of the new Spike Horns and showed
them his wonderful two-point antlers.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>But somehow they didn't seem at all
impressed. They were too much taken up
with their own spikes to pay any attention
to Nimble.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he said to himself, "we
'two-pointers' can have some good mock
battles together."</p>

<p>And they did. They had mock battles
that became famous all around Blue
Mountain. And of all the "two-pointers"
that lived in that neighborhood, Nimble
and his friend Dodger the Deer were
known as the best sham-fighters. They
could look fiercer and act angrier than
any of their young friends. And the way
they tore into each other was almost
enough to frighten you, if you had seen
them.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow said it was worth flying
a mile to watch one of their set-tos.</p>

<h3>A MOCK BATTLE</h3>

<p>When Nimble had three-points on each
of his antlers, in his fourth summer, he
felt that he was at last grown up. He was
now a "three-pointer." Some of the older
bucks had no more points than he. Many
of them were but "four-pointers." His
own father had been a "five-pointer." So
Nimble hoped, secretly, that he would have
five-point antlers in another two years.</p>

<p>As soon as his new horns were ready
Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer
began their mock battles again. And Nimble
found them greater fun than ever.</p>

<p>Dodger was a spry fellow. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
quick as a flash at dodging. When Nimble
ran at him with head lowered and horns
aimed straight at him Dodger could wait
until Nimble all but struck him, before
leaping aside. And then Nimble would go
rushing past him.</p>

<p>But Dodger did not always dodge when
attacked. Sometimes he stood his ground,
with his own head lowered in a threatening
fashion. And then Nimble checked
his headlong rush and merely clashed his
horns pleasantly against Dodger's.</p>

<p>There was something about the sound
that sent a thrill through Nimble and
started his coat to bristling along his backbone
with a queer, creepy feeling.</p>

<p>One day in the fall Nimble's mother
came upon them in the woods when they
were having one of their sham fights.</p>

<p>"You'd better stop that!" she said to
them severely. "Somebody will get hurt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
sooner or later if you're not careful."</p>

<p>Nimble and Dodger paid little heed to
her warning, except to stop until the good
lady had gone on and left them. Then,
just as they were on the point of renewing
their frolic, somebody spoke in a
hoarse voice. It was old Mr. Crow. He sat
on a low branch of a spreading pine,
where he had been watching the contest
for some time without being noticed.</p>

<p>"I'd have my fun if I wanted to," he
croaked. "Ladies are too finicky. They
don't know what a good time is."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Crow's remarks pleased Nimble.
And they pleased Dodger the Deer.
They didn't know that the old gentleman
was a famous trouble maker.</p>

<p>So Dodger and Nimble drew a little distance
apart, as they always did when they
were getting ready to clash.</p>

<p>"Go it!" squalled Mr. Crow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>And they started. And Mr. Crow
jumped up and down in his excitement.</p>

<p>"Now there's going to be some real
fun," he muttered.</p>

<p>But Dodger the Deer leaped aside just
in time to avoid being hit. And that
didn't please Mr. Crow at all.</p>

<p>"You fellows aren't half trying," he
cried impatiently. "Anyone would think
you were a pair of Spike Horns."</p>

<p>Now, all Spike Horns were two whole
years younger than Dodger and Nimble.
So it was no wonder that Mr. Crow's
words stung them.</p>

<p>Nimble charged more fiercely than ever.
And Dodger stood his ground. With his
feet planted firmly beneath him he waited
for the blow.</p>

<p>There was a crack and a thud.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Mr. Crow squawked. "That's
a little more like it. Dodger didn't dodge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
that time, to be sure. But he stood still.
And only a Spike Horn would stand and
<i>wait</i> for the enemy."</p>

<p>Of course Dodger couldn't help wanting
to show Mr. Crow that he knew how to
carry on a mock battle. So the next time
Nimble rushed at him Dodger did not
wait. He jumped to meet Nimble. They
struck in the air with a frightful crash
and fell sprawling upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Ha! That's more like it!" Mr. Crow
applauded. "That's the sort of mock battle
I like to see!"</p>

<h3>MR. CROW LOOKS ON</h3>

<p>Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer
picked themselves up off the ground
where they had fallen after their collision
in the air. They did not feel any too pleasant.
One of Dodger's sharp tines had
given Nimble a good prick. And one of
Nimble's points had stung Dodger like a
hornet's sting.</p>

<p>If only one of them had been pricked
the whole affair might have ended differently.
For then perhaps only one of them
would have lost his temper. As they drew
apart they were growing more angry
every instant. And when they wheeled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
and glared at each other old Mr. Crow,
who was watching them from his perch in
the pine tree, called out: <a name="stop" id="stop"></a>"Don't stop!
Make it lively, now!"</p>

<p>Nimble gritted his teeth and stamped
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you not to prick me!" he
muttered.</p>

<p>"I'll make you wish you'd left those
new antlers at home!" cried Dodger the
Deer.</p>

<p>"Don't stop!" old Mr. Crow urged
them once more as he teetered on his
perch. "Let the fun go on!"</p>

<p>He squalled so loudly that his cousin
Jasper Jay heard him half a mile away
and came hurrying up to see what was
going on. He arrived just in time to see
Nimble and Dodger stagger back from
another mad charge.</p>

<p>"What's this? A mock battle?" Jasper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
Jay inquired as he settled down beside Mr.
Crow.</p>

<p>"No!" Mr. Crow replied in muffled
tones. "It is a real one&mdash;but they don't
know it yet."</p>

<p>Next to quarreling himself, old Mr.
Crow loved to look on while others
wrangled. And though he had no taste
himself for actual fighting, he liked to see
his neighbors pummel and peck and buffet
and bounce one another.</p>

<p>So Mr. Crow enjoyed watching the tilt
between Nimble and Dodger the Deer.
Neither Mr. Crow, nor his rowdy cousin
Jasper Jay, had ever seen so furious a
fracas as that one soon became. Sometimes
Nimble and Dodger rushed together
with such force that it seemed to Mr. Crow
their horns must break off. Sometimes
they reared and struck each other with
their front hoofs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>At first, whenever he felt a hurt Nimble
only fought the harder. When Dodger's
horns gouged him and his hoofs cut him
Nimble butted and thrust and struck all
the faster. But for every buffet he repaid
Dodger, Dodger gave him another
that was heavier than ever.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that in time Nimble
began to feel tired. But he didn't let
Dodger the Deer know that.</p>

<p>"This was easy to start," Nimble
thought, "but it seems hard to stop. I
wish Dodger would run away."</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Crow and Jasper
Jay agreed that the battle was growing
tamer every moment.</p>

<p>"Hustle it up!" Mr. Crow called to
Nimble and Dodger, while Jasper Jay
jeered at them both and told them they
were mollycoddles.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't call this a mock battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
now," Mr. Crow told them. "It's more
like a game of tag."</p>

<p>"If only Dodger would run away!"
Nimble said under his breath. "I'll stop
a minute and see if he won't." So he
stood still, with his nose all but touching
the ground.</p>

<p>Dodger the Deer did not run. But he
paused and stood exactly as Nimble was
standing.</p>

<p>So they eyed each other for a while.
And neither of them said a word.</p>

<p>"Come!" cried old Mr. Crow. "This
will never do. Give us more action!"</p>

<p>And then Dodger the Deer looked up
at Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay and spoke.</p>

<p>"If you want more action why don't
you two furnish it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea!" Nimble exclaimed.
"Let's see a mock battle up in
the tree!"</p>

had to meet a friend down the valley. "I
must be flapping along," he said. And off
he went.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay grinned and winked at Nimble
and Dodger behind Mr. Crow's back.
And then with a loud squall&mdash;which might
have meant almost anything&mdash;he too flew
away.</p>

<p>"That was the liveliest mock battle we
ever had," Nimble remarked to his friend
Dodger.</p>

<p>Dodger agreed with what he said.</p>

<p>Nimble's mother gasped when she saw
her son a little later.</p>

<p>"You're a terrible sight!" she told him
severely. "What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"I've been having fun with Dodger the
Deer," Nimble explained. "But to tell
the truth, it wasn't as much fun as I had
expected."</p>

<h3>WHAT BROWNIE WANTED</h3>

<p>Nimble Deer had stopped at Brownie
Beaver's pond to get a drink. Just as he
raised his head from the water he spied
Brownie a little way off, on the bank,
gnawing at a box alder tree.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" Nimble called to him.</p>

<p>"Good evening!" Brownie Beaver answered.</p>

<p>"I see you're busy, as usual," Nimble
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Brownie replied. "And what
are you doing&mdash;if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm just rambling about," Nimble
explained.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>"Then you're not doing much of anything,"
said Brownie Beaver.</p>

<p>Nimble admitted that he wasn't.</p>

<p>"Since you're not working, perhaps
you'll be willing to help me," Brownie
suggested.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" Nimble cried. He liked
Brownie Beaver. Everybody liked him&mdash;unless
it was Timothy Turtle, who had a
grudge against the whole Beaver tribe.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can make arrangements with
you to&mdash;&mdash;" Brownie began.</p>

<p>"Of course you can!" Nimble interrupted.</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you," Brownie
said. "I'm sure I'm much obliged to
you."</p>

<p>"You're quite welcome," Nimble assured
him.</p>

<p>"You're sure you won't mind!"
Brownie Beaver inquired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>"Not at all! No, indeed! What is it
you want me to do for you? Do you want
me to help you roll a log into the water,
when you've finished cutting down that
tree? I might use my horns for a cant
hook, such as the lumbermen have."</p>

<p>"No! It's not that&mdash;thank you!"
Brownie Beaver mumbled. He had not
stopped working, while he talked. And
having some chips in his mouth he did not
speak any too clearly.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd like me to walk back and
forth along the top of your dam and make
it firmer," Nimble suggested.</p>

<p>"No, it's not that," Brownie told him.
"The dam is firm. It has been here a great
many years, ever since my great-great-grandfather's
time.... You've noticed
my house, I dare say," he went on.</p>

<p>"I have," Nimble answered. "It's a
good one, though the chimney looks a bit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
lopsided, to me. Shall I give it a push and
see if I can straighten it?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed&mdash;thank you!" said Brownie
hurriedly. "For mercy's sake, don't
touch my chimney! I worked a long time
to make it. And if I do say so, it's the best
one in the whole village."</p>

<p>Well, Nimble Deer couldn't guess what
it was that Brownie Beaver wanted him
to do. He couldn't think of any other way
in which he might help.</p>

<p>"Then what&mdash;" he demanded&mdash;"what
is it you want?"</p>

<p>"There's something I need for my
house," Brownie explained.</p>

<p>"Shingles!" Nimble cried.</p>

<p>"No!" Brownie said, as he shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't want a pair of antlers
to fasten over your chimney piece!"
Nimble exclaimed. "I shouldn't care to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
part with my antlers&mdash;not just at
present!"</p>

<p>"No!" Brownie said once more.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," Nimble replied.
For a moment he had been worried.</p>

<p>And then Brownie Beaver told him
what he had in mind: "I need a flag to
fly over my house."</p>

<p>"That would be fine," Nimble observed.
"But I don't see how I could help you
with that."</p>

<p>"I've heard that you have a flag. I
thought perhaps you'd let me have it&mdash;or
borrow it, at least," Brownie Beaver
told him.</p>

<p>Nimble Deer looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I haven't any flag," he said. And
then he cried, "Yes! Yes, I have one!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I was told you had," said
Brownie Beaver.</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>"Old Mr. Crow!" Brownie Beaver said.</p>

<p>"I might have known it," Nimble muttered.
"He has played a joke on you. It's
true that I have a flag; but it's not the
kind of flag you want. Some people call
my tail a flag, on account of the way I
wave it in the air when I'm startled. Of
course you wouldn't care to have my tail
on the top of your house."</p>

<p>And Brownie Beaver admitted that he
shouldn't.</p>

<p>"But I can't help being disappointed,"
he confessed.</p>

<h3>THE MULEY COW</h3>

<p>Nimble Deer was a famous jumper. And
so was the Muley Cow. In Farmer
Green's herd there was no other that could
match her.</p>

<p>Living as he did in the pasture, Billy
Woodchuck had often seen and admired
the Muley Cow as she jumped the fence
in order to get into the clover patch, or
the cornfield, or the orchard.</p>

<p>And Jimmy Rabbit, who lived in the
woods, had come to believe&mdash;and even
boast&mdash;that there wasn't anyone that
could jump higher than Nimble Deer.</p>

<p>So Billy Woodchuck and Jimmy Rabbit
could never agree upon this question of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
the best jumper in Pleasant Valley. And
there was only one way to settle their difference
of opinion. Old Mr. Crow told
them that.</p>

<p>"You must have a contest," he declared.</p>

<p>And everybody was willing. The Muley
Cow said (when asked) that she would be
delighted. And when Nimble Deer heard
of the plan he ran all the way to the back
pasture at once. For that was where Mr.
Crow said the contest ought to take place.</p>

<p>Nimble reached the back pasture just in
time to see the Muley Cow arrive there.
She leaped the fence. And at the same
time she grazed the top rail.</p>

<p>"Good morning, madam!" Nimble said
to the Muley Cow. And while she was answering
him Nimble jumped the fence into
the pasture from which the Muley Cow
had come; and then he jumped back again,
into the back pasture. And he didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
touch the fence by so much as a single hair.</p>

<p>Then Billy Woodchuck crawled under
the fence and came hurrying up.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm just stretching my legs a bit,"
Nimble explained. At that answer Billy
Woodchuck set up a loud clamor. "It's
not fair!" he howled. "I expected the
Muley Cow to win the contest. But if
you're going to stretch your legs she'll
certainly be beaten unless she stretches
hers too."</p>

<p>Now, old Mr. Crow was on hand to see
the fun. And not being very friendly
with the Muley Cow he didn't want her to
win the contest. So he began to squall.</p>

<p>"She mustn't stretch her legs any more
than Nimble stretches his," he objected in
his hoarse croak. "Nimble jumped the
fence twice to stretch his legs. She has
jumped once already. Let her jump the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
fence once more and then they'll be even
and the real contest can begin."</p>

<p>"That's fair enough," said Jimmy
Rabbit. But Billy Woodchuck began to
chatter and scold.</p>

<p>"It's a trick&mdash;a trick of Mr. Crow's!"
he cried. "If the Muley Cow jumps once
more to stretch her legs she'll be on the
wrong side of the fence. She won't be in
the back pasture then. And how could she
have the contest with Nimble Deer?"</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow gave a loud haw-haw.
But he still insisted that the Muley Cow
might have only one more leg-stretching
jump, when Jimmy Rabbit hurried up to
him and said something nobody else could
hear. And Mr. Crow listened and then
nodded his head.</p>

<p>"It's all right," the old gentleman told
Billy Woodchuck. "Let the Muley Cow
stretch her legs all she likes."</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span></p>
<h2  class="t"><a name="Jump" id="Jump">XIX</a></h2>

<h3>THE JUMPING CONTEST</h3>

<p>Having had Mr. Crow's permission, the
Muley Cow went on stretching her legs as
much as she pleased. She jumped the pasture
fence; and she jumped it back again.
And when she seemed about to stop Billy
Woodchuck whispered to her, "You may
as well keep a-stretching them. Keep a-jumping!
And when the time for the real
contest with Nimble Deer comes your legs
will be stretched so long that you'll beat
Nimble without the slightest trouble."</p>

<p>So the Muley Cow jumped over the
fence and back, over the fence and back.
And when at last she said she was ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
for the contest Billy Woodchuck still
urged her to stretch her legs a bit more.</p>

<p>By the time he was willing to let her
stop the Muley Cow's sides were heaving.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jimmy Rabbit and Billy
Woodchuck, with Mr. Crow's help, had
picked out a clump of young hawthorns
for the first test. And now that everybody
was ready for the contest Nimble Deer
cleared the clump gracefully, with a foot
to spare.</p>

<p>Then came the Muley Cow's turn. She
looked worried as she fell into a lumbering
gallop and ran towards the prickly
young trees. And with a mighty effort
she tried to fling herself over them.</p>

<p>As she rose into the air she gave a bellow
of dismay, to fall floundering the next
instant into the thorny thicket.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit began to hop about in
circles. He knew that Nimble had won<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
the contest and Jimmy was very happy.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow haw-hawed. The Muley
Cow had lost the contest and he was glad.</p>

<p>Nimble watched the Muley Cow as she
struggled amid the hawthorns, trying to
scramble out of the tangle.</p>

<p>"Can I help you, madam?" he asked.</p>

<p>But she never even thanked him. She
was so upset that she neither wanted anybody
to speak to her nor did she wish to
speak to anybody else.</p>

<p>As for Billy Woodchuck, he looked
frightfully disappointed. He had expected
the Muley Cow to win the jumping
contest. And there she was, beaten at the
very first jump!</p>

<p>He stole up to her; and standing on his
hind legs, to get as near her as he could,
he said, "It's a pity you lost! I don't believe
you stretched your legs enough."</p>

<p>The Muley Cow snorted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>"That's not the reason why," she
snapped. "I stretched my legs <i>too much</i>.
I jumped the fence until I was so tired I
could scarcely stand. It's no wonder that
Nimble beat me."</p>

<p>Nimble Deer could see that the Muley
Cow was feeling quite glum. After she
had struggled free of the thorns he went
up to her and bowed in his most polite
manner. "Is there anything I can do for
you?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes! Do let down the bars for me!"
she gasped. "I want to go home. And I
couldn't jump that fence again. It would
be dangerous for me to try. I might fall
and break a leg off. And then I'd have a
short leg the rest of my life."</p>

<p>"You could stretch it," old Mr. Crow
suggested.</p>

<p>But the Muley Cow turned her back on
him and walked away.</p>

<h3>SOLVING A PROBLEM</h3>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit was going to give a party.
Up and down Pleasant Valley and all
about Blue Mountain the field and forest
people were talking about it.</p>

<p>Almost everybody had an invitation.
There were only a few that weren't asked.
Jimmy Rabbit didn't intend to invite
Grumpy Weasel because he was a rascal.
And Timothy Turtle wasn't to be one of
the guests because he would be sure to
grumble at everybody and everything.</p>

<p>And then there was Nimble Deer.
Jimmy Rabbit said that Nimble was <i>too
big</i> to come to his party. And every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
told Jimmy Rabbit that it was a pity. All
the neighbors said so much that Jimmy
Rabbit didn't know what to do.</p>

<p>"If I don't ask Nimble you won't be
pleased," Jimmy complained to Billy
Woodchuck. "And if I do ask him and
he should happen to step on you during a
dance you wouldn't like that."</p>

<p>"Invite him; but keep him away from
the crowd!" Billy Woodchuck suggested.</p>

<p>"How can I do that?" Jimmy Rabbit
demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Billy replied. "But I
am sure you can find a way, if anybody
can."</p>

<p>Well, after that remark there was nothing
Jimmy Rabbit could do except to put
on his thinking cap. But try as he would,
he couldn't hit upon a single plan.</p>

<p>Now, Nimble Deer had no idea of all
the trouble he was causing Jimmy Rabbit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
To be sure, he knew that he was not invited
to Jimmy Rabbit's party. But he
was no person to sulk or feel hurt over
such a matter.</p>

<p>However, there was one thing that he
thought was odd. Wherever he went he
was sure to come upon Jimmy Rabbit.
Sometimes Nimble would hear a faint
rustle. And when he looked around he
would catch a glimpse of Jimmy Rabbit
ducking out of sight behind a tree. Sometimes
Nimble would be taking a nap under
the shelter of a clump of evergreens. And
he would wake up suddenly with a strange
feeling that somebody was watching him.
And almost always he would discover
Jimmy Rabbit crouching near-by and
staring at him.</p>

<p>At first, at such times, Nimble only
spoke pleasantly to Jimmy Rabbit. Still
he couldn't help noticing that Jimmy Rab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>bit
always acted queerly. He seemed to
be absent minded. If Nimble bade him a
cheerful good morning Jimmy Rabbit was
likely to reply with a good evening. If
Nimble said, "It's a fine day," Jimmy
would say, "Yes! It does look like rain."</p>

<p>At last, one day, Jimmy Rabbit made
the oddest answer of all. When Nimble
spied him peering from behind a stump
he called, "Hullo! I'm glad to see you."
To which remark Jimmy Rabbit said, "I
hope to see you later."</p>

<p>"Now, I wonder&mdash;" Nimble mused&mdash;"I
wonder what he means." And then Nimble
asked Jimmy Rabbit a question: "Are
you feeling well?"</p>

<p>"As well as could be expected!" Jimmy
Rabbit told him.</p>

<p>"You don't seem like yourself," said
Nimble. "I haven't seen you smile for
over a week."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>Then, strangely enough, Jimmy Rabbit
jumped into the air and kicked and
smiled.</p>

<p>"At last," he cried, "I feel better. I
have solved the problem. Will you come
to my party and help me a week from to-night?"</p>

<p>Nimble Deer thanked him and said that
he would.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<h2  class="t"><a name="Secret" id="Secret">XXI</a></h2>

<h3>AN UNTOLD SECRET</h3>

<p>All the field and forest people soon knew
that at last Jimmy Rabbit had invited
Nimble Deer to his party. And everybody
was pleased&mdash;that is, everybody except
Grumpy Weasel and old Timothy
Turtle, who were left out in the cold, so
to speak. Grumpy Weasel, when he heard
the news, said, "Humph!" And Timothy
Turtle, when he heard it, said, "Ho!"
And they both declared that they were
<i>glad</i> they were not going to the party.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow carried the news far and
wide. It was he that told Billy Woodchuck,
in Farmer Green's clover patch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
And Billy Woodchuck almost choked
over a clover top, he was so excited.</p>

<p>"Where's Jimmy Rabbit?" he asked
Mr. Crow. "I want to ask him something."</p>

<p>"I couldn't say where he is," said Mr.
Crow. "I don't think he'd want me to
tell. But I'll find him for you and I'll
ask him your question&mdash;if you'll tell me
what it is." That was Mr. Crow's way.
He was so curious.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Billy Woodchuck.
"I don't want to trouble you, Mr. Crow."</p>

<p>And though Mr. Crow tried to learn
what the question was, Billy Woodchuck
wouldn't tell him.</p>

<p>Later Billy was almost sorry he hadn't
accepted Mr. Crow's help. For he couldn't
find Jimmy Rabbit anywhere. And then
Billy happened to meet Nimble Deer.</p>

<p>"I hear you're going to the party,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
Billy said to him. "How are you going to
keep out of the crowd?" That was the
question he had wanted to ask Jimmy
Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Keep out of the crowd!" Nimble exclaimed.
"I don't expect to keep out of
it. The crowd at a party is more than half
the fun. Since I'm to help Jimmy Rabbit
I'll have to be where the people are."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Billy Woodchuck. He had
been a bit worried, for he didn't want
Nimble Deer to step on him at the party.
Even though it might be an accident, being
stepped on by so big a chap as Nimble
would be no joke. Everybody knew that
Nimble's hoofs were sharp.</p>

<p>But now Billy had learned something
that set his fears at rest. Nimble Deer
was going to <i>help</i> Jimmy at the party.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Billy Woodchuck murmured to
himself. "That means that Jimmy Rab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>bit
has a plan. And it must be a good one;
for his plans are always fine."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to help?" he
asked Nimble.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Rabbit didn't tell me," Nimble
replied. "Maybe I'm to entertain the
company by having a mock battle with
somebody. How would you like to have a
mock battle with me?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't care for it at all!"</p>

<p>"Well, I dare say <i>somebody</i> would enjoy
a sham fight," said Nimble. "I must
ask Jimmy Rabbit who it will be."</p>

<p>So the next time Nimble found Jimmy
Rabbit he asked him that very question.</p>

<p>But Jimmy Rabbit said there were to
be no battles of any kind at his party.</p>

<p>"Then how am I going to help you?"</p>

<p>"You're going to use your horns&mdash;but
not to fight," Jimmy Rabbit explained.</p>

<p>And he wouldn't say another word.</p>

<h3>THE NEW HAT-RACK</h3>

<p>The night of Jimmy Rabbit's party arrived
at last. The time was an hour after
sunset. The place was Farmer Green's
back pasture. And Jimmy Rabbit was
waiting eagerly. He had told Nimble
Deer to come early, before the other
guests, because Nimble was going to help
him.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit hadn't waited long when
he heard a muffled thud, followed by a
swift patter.</p>

<p>"There's Nimble now!" he exclaimed.
"He just jumped the stone wall and he's
coming this way."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>Jimmy Rabbit was right. In a few seconds
more Nimble Deer stood before him.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" Nimble cried. "I've
come early and I'm ready to help you."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Jimmy Rabbit. "Step
this way, please!" And he hopped over
to a clump of evergreens. Nimble followed
him.</p>

<p>"Now," Jimmy Rabbit went on, "step
inside this thicket and let only your head
and neck stick out!"</p>

<p>"What shall I do with my antlers?"
Nimble asked him. "They won't come off,
because it's the wrong time of year to shed
them."</p>

<p>"Oh! I want your antlers to show too,"
Jimmy Rabbit assured him.</p>

<p>So Nimble did exactly as Jimmy Rabbit
had told him.</p>

<p>Then Jimmy sat up a little way off,
cocked his head on one side, and looked at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
Nimble. "That's fine!" he declared.
"When the moon comes up everybody will
be able to see you&mdash;except what's hidden
by the evergreens."</p>

<p>"What am I going to do here?" Nimble
inquired.</p>

<p>"You're to stand perfectly still,"
Jimmy explained.</p>

<p>"And what else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" Jimmy Rabbit answered.
"The other guests will do the rest.... And
now, if you don't mind, I'll leave you
here; for I hear somebody coming."</p>

<p>He scampered away then. But soon he
came hurrying back.</p>

<p>"There's something I forgot to say,"
he told Nimble hurriedly. "You mustn't
talk. You mustn't even open your mouth.
You mustn't even chew your cud."</p>

<p>"I suppose I can wink if I want to,"
said Nimble Deer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>"No, indeed!" Jimmy Rabbit cried.
"That would spoil everything."</p>

<p>"It's going to be hard," Nimble complained,
"to keep so still."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Jimmy Rabbit assured him.
"It will be easy. Just act as if you were
stuffed!"</p>

<p>"Stuffed!" Nimble exclaimed. "I've
never been stuffed. I hope I never shall
be. And I don't know how to act as if I
were."</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit didn't even wait to hear
what Nimble said, but whisked away
again.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" Nimble muttered. "I wish
I hadn't said I'd come to the party and
help. For it certainly won't be any fun
to stand still in this thicket, with only my
head and neck sticking out."</p>

<p>However, he had promised to help. So
there was nothing to be done except to fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>low
Jimmy Rabbit's orders. And at once
Nimble could hear Jimmy Rabbit welcoming
some early guests.</p>

<p>"Come this way and leave your hats and
coats!" Jimmy Rabbit was saying. And
soon he returned with Billy Woodchuck
and Fatty Coon at his heels. Jimmy led
them straight to the place where Nimble
stood.</p>

<p>"Hang your things on my new hat-rack!"
Jimmy Rabbit told them as he
waved a paw toward Nimble's antlers.</p>

<p>And to Nimble's amazement they
reached up to do as they were told.</p>

<p>But Nimble's antlers were too high for
them.</p>

<p>It was a bad moment for Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<hr />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span></p>
<h2  class="t"><a name="How" id="How">XXIII</a></h2>

<h3>HOW NIMBLE HELPED</h3>

<p>Billy Woodchuck and Fatty Coon had
come early to Jimmy Rabbit's party. And
Jimmy had told them to hang their hats
and coats upon his new hat-rack&mdash;meaning
Nimble Deer's antlers. But when
they tried to do as they were bid they
found that the antlers were beyond their
reach.</p>

<p>Of course Jimmy Rabbit was most uncomfortable.
He coughed and gave Nimble
an odd look. He even nodded his head
at Nimble behind his guests' backs, thereby
doing his best to give Nimble a hint to
lower his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>But Nimble Deer couldn't imagine what
Jimmy Rabbit meant. Hadn't Jimmy
warned him not to move&mdash;not even to open
his mouth, or chew his cud, or wink? So
Nimble stood like a statue.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I see my new hat-rack is too
high," Jimmy Rabbit stammered. "Let
me take your hats and coats and I'll hang
them up for you while you go and wait
for the rest of the company over by the
stone wall!"</p>

<p>So Billy Woodchuck and Fatty Coon
gave their hats and coats to Jimmy.</p>

<p>"That's a fine Deer's head," Fatty remarked.
"It seems to me I've seen it
before somewhere."</p>

<p>"Perhaps! Perhaps!" Jimmy Rabbit
answered. He wished his guests would
move away.</p>

<p>"Those antlers remind me of Nimble
Deer's," Billy Woodchuck remarked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
And he gave Nimble a wink, for he had
quickly guessed the secret of the hat-rack
and how Jimmy Rabbit had planned to
have Nimble at his party and yet keep
him out of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Is this Deer's head stuffed?" Billy
Woodchuck asked Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<p>"Perhaps! Perhaps!" Jimmy muttered.
"Move along, please!"</p>

<p>Nimble wanted to return that wink that
Billy Woodchuck gave him. But he
didn't, because Jimmy Rabbit had warned
him to keep perfectly still.</p>

<p>As soon as his guests had left them
Jimmy whispered to Nimble, "Lower your
head a bit, for pity's sake!"</p>

<p>Nimble promptly obeyed him. And
Jimmy Rabbit hung the hats and coats
upon Nimble's antlers.</p>

<p>"Now," Jimmy said, "keep your head
exactly where it is!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>"I suppose I may raise it after everybody
has come to the party," Nimble
ventured.</p>

<p>"No! That would never do," Jimmy
Rabbit replied firmly. "If anybody happened
to come back to get a pocket-handkerchief
out of his coat he'd be sure to
notice the difference."</p>

<p>A sigh escaped Nimble Deer.</p>

<p>"My neck will ache before the evening's
over," he said. "Couldn't I take a short
walk in the woods, later, to rest myself?"</p>

<p>"My goodness, no!" Jimmy cried.
"You'd be sure to lose some of the hats
and coats, or tear them on some briars, or
get them full of burs."</p>

<p>"How long is the party going to last?"
Nimble asked.</p>

<p>"Only till midnight!"</p>

<p>At that Nimble gave a groan.</p>

<p>"S-s-h!" Jimmy Rabbit laid a paw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
upon his lips. "Keep still! Stuffed animals
never talk. If you don't look out
somebody will hear you."</p>

<p>And then he hurried away to join his
guests. He did not want to leave them
alone too long. He feared they might be
saying things to each other about his new
hat-rack.</p>

<h2  class="t"><a name="Chuck" id="Chuck">XXIV</a></h2>

<h3>UNCLE JERRY CHUCK</h3>

<p>Soon Jimmy Rabbit's friends arrived at
his party in throngs. And soon Nimble
Deer's antlers bristled with hats and coats
of many kinds and colors.</p>

<p>"I must look like a Christmas tree,"
Nimble thought. "I wish Jimmy Rabbit
and his friends would come and dance
around me so I might see the fun."</p>

<p>But they didn't. They stayed down in
a little hollow some distance away. Nimble
could hear their voices. And they
seemed to be having a delightful time.</p>

<p>As for Nimble, he wasn't having a good
time at all. "I'll never help at another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
party!" he promised himself. He couldn't
believe that midnight&mdash;and the end of the
party&mdash;would ever come.</p>

<p>At last, however, he took heart. For
old Uncle Jerry Chuck came hurrying up
and began taking hats and coats off Nimble's
antlers. And Nimble knew then that
the party must be almost over.</p>

<p>"This is a good hat!" Uncle Jerry muttered
to himself. "I'll take it." And
then he said, "This is a good coat! I'll
take it." Then he looked closely at another
hat. "This is a good one, too!" he
remarked. "I might lose the other. I'll
take this one, too&mdash;and this coat here," he
added, selecting a second coat that pleased
him.</p>

<p>Little did Uncle Jerry Chuck dream
that the Deer's head was a real, live one.
And just as the old chap reached for the
second coat Nimble Deer had to cough.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
He didn't want to. Hadn't Jimmy Rabbit
cautioned him not to stir&mdash;not to open his
mouth?</p>

<p>But the cough came all the same, right
in Uncle Jerry Chuck's ear. <a name="fright" id="fright"></a>And Uncle
Jerry jumped. He dropped both hats and
both coats. And then he waddled off as
fast as he could go and scrambled over
the stone wall, out of sight. He didn't
even wait to get his own rusty coat and
tattered hat, which he had left lying on
the ground.</p>

<p>Uncle Jerry hadn't been gone long when
all the company came jostling up to Nimble.
Everybody&mdash;except Nimble&mdash;was
very merry. Amid a good many jokes the
company put on their hats and coats, until
only Aunt Polly Woodchuck's poke bonnet
hung from Nimble's horns.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;just for fun&mdash;Jimmy Rabbit set
the bonnet on Nimble's head and tied its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
strings under his chin. And Aunt Polly
Woodchuck herself laughed hardest of all.</p>

<p>And then all at once something happened.
A dog barked. "It's old dog
Spot!" somebody cried.</p>

<p>Nimble Deer was the first to run. One
leap took him out of the evergreen thicket
in which he had been standing all the
evening. Three leaps more took him over
the stone wall.</p>

<p>After that nobody saw him&mdash;nor Aunt
Polly Woodchuck's bonnet&mdash;again that
night.</p>

<p>The whole company scattered and vanished
like baby grouse surprised in the
woods. And when old dog Spot reached
the clump of evergreens a few moments
later he found nothing to show that there
had been a party there&mdash;that is, he found
nothing except a battered hat and a rusty
coat lying on the ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>Spot sniffed at them. "Unless I'm mistaken,
Uncle Jerry Chuck has forgotten
something," he murmured. "No doubt
he'll be back here in a little while."</p>

<p>So Spot waited and waited there.</p>

<p>But Uncle Jerry Chuck was half a mile
away and sound asleep in his underground
chamber.</p>

<p class="b">And Nimble Deer was a mile away, over
in Cedar Swamp, trying to tear Aunt
Polly's bonnet off his head by rubbing his
horns against a young cedar.</p>
